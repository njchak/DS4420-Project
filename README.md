# DS4420-Project

This project uses a neural network to predict the outcome of a March Madness tournament. This is built off of a previous project in another class, where I used naive bayes and a random forest classifier to determine the outcome of the games.

This repo includes code for both projects, with the old project having its own folder. Plots used in the final report are in the *Plots* folder, and data used for this project is in the *ncaam-march-mania-2021* folder.

Also added *Project Code.py* for readability in repo; same contents as .ipynb file.

### Dependencies
