### Problem:
We want to create a model to determine the winner of a March Madness 
game, given the matchup and seeding.

<p>March Madness is broken up into 4 regions, each with 16 teams, seeded
1 through 16. Every first matchup is the same. Then, the winner of 
each region then moves on to play in semifinals. 
The winners of those games plays in the championship game. A single region
is pictured below:</p>

# Import the dataset showing tournament results. Our data contains

# HigherSeed and LowerSeed

                         data = training_data)

# Let's try adding teams, and see if that gives us a stronger accuracy
# for the model.

                         + UnfavoritedTeam, 
                         data = training_data)

modelMatrix <- confusionMatrix(prediction, test_data$Winning.Seed)

modelMatrix
```
```{r}
# Finally, let's add region and round into the mix. All variables
# added are independent, so this will fit into naive bayes.

bballModel <- naiveBayes(Winning.Seed ~ HigherSeed + LowerSeed + FavoritedTeam
                         + UnfavoritedTeam + Round + Region, 
                         data = training_data)

prediction <- predict(bballModel, test_data)

modelMatrix <- confusionMatrix(prediction, test_data$Winning.Seed)

modelMatrix
```

<p> Looking at Sensitivity for each class, we see that it decreases with each 
lower seed. True positive rating is between 70 - 80% for most classes.</p>

```{r}

# Create a random forest model to see if this gives better results 
# than naive bayes. If it is a better fitting model for the data, the 
# confusion matrix will have a higher accuracy. 

rf_model <- randomForest(Winning.Seed ~ HigherSeed + LowerSeed + Round +
                           Region, data = training_data, importance = TRUE, ntree = 1000)
rf_model 
varImpPlot(rf_model)

rf_prediction <- predict(rf_model, test_data)
confusionMatrix(test_data$Winning.Seed, rf_prediction)
```

<p>Based off of the higher accuracy of the naive bayes model via the confusion
matrix, we determine 
that the naive bayes model performs better than the random forest model. 
However, creating the second model was necessary to determine that we had the
right model in naive bayes, and it also shows us that higherSeed and LowerSeed
are the most important variables in the model.</p>

### Model Evaluation and Conclusion:
Our naive bayes model is about 75-80% accurate. By using our model to make your
bracket, you have about a 75% chance to get any individual game to result in 
a correct 
outcome. There are limitations to this model, one of which being if two 
teams of the same seeding (i.e. a 1 seed vs a 1 seed) face off in the semifinals
or finals. To improve on the concept of predicting a winner for the match, a 
future model could be constructed that gives the winning team instead of the 
winning seed number. Also, you can incorporate season stats for a team to 
make an even stronger model, since season stats indicate a lot about a team's 
performance. To conclude, I would determine that this model is not strong enough
to make an ideal bracket, but can be used as a supplement if the user needs 
assistance in a match by match basis.
